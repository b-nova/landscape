If you've researched cloud native applications and technologies, you've probably come
across the [CNCF cloud native landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io). Unsurprisingly,
the sheer scale of it can be overwhelming. So many categories and so many technologies.
How do you make sense of it?

As with anything else, if you break it down and analyze it one piece at a time, you'll
find it's not that complex and makes a lot of sense. In fact, the map is neatly organized
by functionality and, once you understand what each category represents, navigating it
becomes a lot easier.

In this guide, we’ll break this mammoth landscape down and provide a high-level overview
of its layers, columns, and categories.

### What is the cloud native landscape?

The goal of the cloud native landscape is to compile and organize all cloud native open
ource projects and proprietary products into categories, providing an overview of the
current ecosystem. Organizations that have a cloud native project or product can
[submit a PR](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/) to request it to be added to the
landscape.

### How to use this guide

In this guide, you'll find one chapter per layer and column which discusses each category
within it. Categories are broken down into: what it is, the problem it addresses, how it
helps, and technical 101. While the first three sections assume no technical background,
the technical 101 is targeted to engineers just getting started with cloud native. We
also included a section for associates buzzwords and lists CNCF projects

> ##### INFOBOX
>
> When looking at the landscape, you'll note a few distinctions:
>  * Projects in large boxes are CNCF-hosted open source projects. Some are still in
>    the incubation phase (light blue/purple frame), while others are graduated
>    projects (dark blue frame).
>  * Projects in small white boxes are open source projects.
>  * Products in gray boxes are proprietary products.
>
> Please note that new projects are continuously becoming part of the CNCF so
> always refer to the actual landscape – things are moving fast!
